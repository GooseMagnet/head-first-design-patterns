# Head First Design Patterns

## Design Principles
* Encapsulate what varies
* Program to an interface, not an implementation
* Favor composition over inheritance
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact

## Design Patterns

### Strategy
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.  Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
### Observer
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that whne one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
